    <img class="mini" src="./images/art1.png" class ="left" />
    <p class="center mheight">This piece was drawn just for fun for an instagram challenge! I decided to play with complimentary colors</p>
     <img class="mini" src="./images/art2.png" class ="left" />
     <p class="center mheight">This was just a study of different materials such as glass and leather to help me out with drawing more realisticly</p>
      <img class="mini" src="./images/art3.jpg" class ="left" />
      <p class="center mheight">For my final piece, this is based on a real picture that I took of a crepe that I decided to draw. I wanted to try and improve my texture skills and drawing things to appear more real.</p>
